# GitHub Security Scanner Hook

Scan staged files for secrets and code-level security vulnerabilities before every git commit.
Works with any language or file type — `detect-secrets` finds hardcoded credentials and API keys; `semgrep` finds injection flaws, XSS, path traversal, and OWASP Top 10 patterns across Python, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Java, and more.
Can run as a one-off manual scan or install as an automated git pre-commit hook.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ available on PATH (to create the `.venv`)
- Git repository (any language — Python, JS, Go, Ruby, Java, etc.)
- Staged files to scan, or `--full-repo` to scan everything
- Internet access on first run only (to pip-install `detect-secrets` and `semgrep`)
- Write access to `.git/hooks/` (for hook installation only)

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Set Up `.venv` and Install Tools

Always use `.venv` — create it if it does not exist, then resolve the correct interpreter:

```bash
[ -d .venv ] || python -m venv .venv
PYTHON=$(if [ -f .venv/Scripts/python ]; then echo .venv/Scripts/python; else echo .venv/bin/python; fi)
```

Install `detect-secrets` and `semgrep` into the venv if not already present:

```bash
$PYTHON -m pip show detect-secrets > /dev/null 2>&1 || $PYTHON -m pip install detect-secrets
$PYTHON -m pip show semgrep > /dev/null 2>&1 || $PYTHON -m pip install semgrep
```

Both tools are optional independently — if `semgrep` is not installed the scan still runs with `detect-secrets` only. Semgrep uses the bundled rules in `rules/security.yml` (no login or network access required).

### Step 2 — Run Security Scan on Staged Files

Run `scan-staged.py` to check all currently staged files:

```bash
$PYTHON .github/skills/github-security-scanner-hook/scripts/scan-staged.py
```

To scan the entire repository instead of only staged files:

```bash
$PYTHON .github/skills/github-security-scanner-hook/scripts/scan-staged.py --full-repo
```

The script prints a JSON summary to stdout and exits with:
- **Exit code 0** — no findings (clean)
- **Exit code 1** — one or more HIGH severity findings (would block the commit)
- **Exit code 2** — only MEDIUM or LOW severity findings (warnings, no block)

### Step 3 — Review and Present Findings

Parse the JSON output and present findings grouped by severity:

- **HIGH** — Must be fixed before committing. Identify the flagged file and line, explain what was found (e.g., "AWS secret key on line 14 of `config.py`"), why it is dangerous, and the specific remediation steps.
- **MEDIUM** — Warn the user with a clear explanation and ask whether they want to fix it first or proceed.
- **LOW** — Mention briefly and move on unless the user asks for detail.

For each finding include: file path, line number, finding type, severity, and a plain-English explanation.
Consult `references/github-security-scanner-hook-reference.md` for the full severity table, finding types, and remediation guidance.

If the scan is clean (exit code 0), confirm clearly: "No security issues found in staged files."

### Step 4 — Install Pre-Commit Hook (Optional)

Ask the user: "Would you like to install this as a git pre-commit hook so every future commit is scanned automatically?"

If yes:

```bash
$PYTHON .github/skills/github-security-scanner-hook/scripts/install-hook.py
```

The installer:
1. Detects whether `.git/hooks/pre-commit` already exists — if it does, it offers to Append (default), Overwrite, or Skip rather than silently destroying existing hooks
2. Creates or extends the hook to call `scan-staged.py` before every commit
3. Makes the hook executable
4. Prints the hook path and a confirmation message

After installation, remind the user:
- The hook lives in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` — this directory is **not tracked by git**, so each contributor must run `install-hook.py` themselves to opt in
- HIGH severity findings block the commit; MEDIUM/LOW prompt a confirmation
- Emergency bypass: `git commit --no-verify` — see the reference for important caveats

### Step 5 — Remediate Issues

For each HIGH or MEDIUM finding the user wants to fix:

1. Open the flagged file at the reported line number
2. **For hardcoded credentials:** Replace with an environment variable (`os.environ["KEY_NAME"]`) or a secrets manager call
3. **For private keys:** Remove the key, revoke it immediately (assume it is compromised), generate a new one, and add the key file pattern to `.gitignore`
4. **For weak cryptography (bandit):** Replace insecure functions — e.g., `hashlib.md5` → `hashlib.sha256`, `random.token_hex` → `secrets.token_hex`
5. **For false positives:** Add to the `.secrets.baseline` allowlist using `python -m detect_secrets audit .secrets.baseline`
6. Re-stage the fixed files and re-run Step 2 to confirm all HIGH findings are resolved
